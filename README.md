# Reinforcement_Learning

Various RL projects

1- "GridWorld" : this is a toy gridworld example based on Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning" book, p.77. 
A policy evaluation and a policy improvement policy algorithms are coded, without use of Gymnasium, to illustrate chapters 3 and 4. The code produces results in p77 :-)

2- "Jack's Car Rental" : another toy case for finite MDP, Sutton and Barto, ch4 p81.
Same idea as 1, a finite and completely known finite MDP is used to illustrate policy evaluation, policy improvement and policy iteration. I did not use Gymnasium, so the reader can get a feel for the actual algorithms. 

The interest of 1 and 2 is mainly theoretical, as real life systems are not known explicitely most of the time.
